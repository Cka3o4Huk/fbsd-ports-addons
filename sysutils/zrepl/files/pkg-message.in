zrepl must be configured before it is started the first time.
- Create the log file /var/log/zrepl.log:
  # service newsyslog restart
- Teach syslogd to redirect facility local0 to the zrepl.log file:
  # service syslogd reload
- Modify the %%PREFIX%%/etc/zrepl/zrepl.yml configuration file
- For remote backups, create the SSH key pair and authorized_keys file
- Enable the zrepl daemon to start automatically at boot:
  # sysrc zrepl_enable="YES"
- Start the zrepl daemon:
  # service zrepl start

*** BREAKING CHANGES WITH THE 0.1.x RELEASE: ***
This release is a milestone for zrepl and required significant refactoring
if not rewrites of substantial parts of the application. It breaks both
configuration and transport format, and thus requires manual intervention
and updates on both sides of a replication setup.

***** Danger *****

The changes in the pruning system for this release require you to explicitly 
define keep rules: for any snapshot that you want to keep, at least one rule
must match. This is different from previous releases where pruning only
affected snapshots with the configured snapshotting prefix. Make sure that 
snapshots to be kept or ignored by zrepl are covered, e.g. by using 
the regex keep rule.
